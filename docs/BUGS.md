# BUGS.md — Bug Ledger

**The single place a bug's status lives.** New and resolved, with a rough report time and (for recent
ones) the taskblock in play. Its job: **a resolved bug must have a closure marker here**, so an old
report — still readable in `taskblock_done/`, still describing acceptance criteria — is never
re-derived as open. If you fixed something, mark it RESOLVED here, even if the fix landed as a plain
commit outside the taskblock cadence. That out-of-cadence gap is exactly what let stale reports
recur.

**Convention:** one flat list, sorted by BR number ascending (`BR26.xx` before `BR27.xx` before
`BR30.xx`, lowest sequence first within a taskblock) — no category sections. **Status is inline in the
entry heading** (`Active` / `Pending Confirmation` / `Resolved`), right after the ID, so status and ID
are both visible while scanning. Entries reported before the `BR<taskblock>.<seq>` convention existed
have no ID to sort by — they follow at the end, in their own legacy block, oldest work first. Recent
entries get a timecode + taskblock; older migrated ones get a rough date. `RESOLVED` entries name the
fixing commit(s)/taskblock so the closure is verifiable.

**Every bug carries an ID:** `BR<taskblock>.<seq>` — e.g. `BR27.01` (Bug Report, reported during
taskblock 27, first of that block). **The ID is assigned at report time and never changes** — a bug
reported in tb27 stays `BR27.xx` even if fixed in tb30, so the handle is stable across its whole life
between supervisor, CC, and the reviewer. Put the ID in the entry heading.

**Every bug carries a `source`:**
- **`CC`** — found by CC during its own work (usually a pure-code bug). CC owns the whole loop
  (sees it, fixes it, tests it), so **CC may mark a `CC`-sourced bug `RESOLVED` directly.**
- **`SUPERVISOR`** — reported by the supervisor (the human overseeing the project). CC often
  *can't see* what was reported (a visual glitch, a "feels wrong" behavior), so it may have fixed
  the wrong thing. **CC may NEVER write plain `RESOLVED` on a `SUPERVISOR`-sourced bug.** The most
  it may write is **`RESOLVED-PENDING-CONFIRMATION`** (fix committed, CC believes it's done,
  awaiting the supervisor's verification). Only the supervisor promotes `PENDING-CONFIRMATION` →
  `RESOLVED`, and only after seeing the fix work.

**Session stamps.** CC has no sequential session counter — what it *does* have is a **session
UUID** embedded in its scratchpad directory path (e.g. `.../83fb8082-732a-4a4f-a726-04186087ef69/
scratchpad`). CC stamps its closure marks with the **full UUID**, not a shortened prefix — a prefix
is one collision away from misattributing a stamp to the wrong session on a long-lived machine, and
the full string costs nothing to write (e.g.
`RESOLVED-PENDING-CONFIRMATION [CC 83fb8082-732a-4a4f-a726-04186087ef69]`). If CC is refreshed it
gets a *new* UUID, so a later session reading an earlier session's `PENDING-CONFIRMATION` sees a
**different** stamp than its own — that's the signal it's *another instance's* unverified claim. It
must NOT promote it to `RESOLVED` on the strength of a prior CC's word, only on the supervisor's. A
pending mark whose UUID isn't your current one is a claim to re-check, not a closure to trust.

**End-of-taskblock digest.** At the end of each taskblock, CC lists every `SUPERVISOR`-sourced bug
it moved to `RESOLVED-PENDING-CONFIRMATION` this block — a "here's what I think I fixed, please
confirm" roll-up — so pending items surface at a natural review point without interrupting mid-work.

### BR26.01 — Pending Confirmation — Opposing team teleports before the player's own attack lands  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** taskblock-26 (bout review): "the last blue unit took its turn and the opposing team
  appeared to jump to new positions before that unit's attack animation resolved."
- **Root cause:** `SquadControlOverlay._on_turn_ended` called `advance_ai_turns(battle)` — which
  fast-forwards every AI turn with NO animation at all, a single instant `refresh_unit_views` at its
  own end — BEFORE the human's own turn had even started its own animated `resolution_player.play()`,
  and that `play()` call wasn't even awaited.
- **Fix:** reordered so the human's own turn is fully awaited through its complete animated playback
  before `advance_ai_turns` runs at all.
- **RESOLVED-PENDING-CONFIRMATION** [CC 83fb8082-732a-4a4f-a726-04186087ef69] — taskblock-26 Pass B1.
- **2026-07-20:** supervisor could not verify — blocked by a separate, new issue encountered during
  the attempt. **Verification deferred to the next taskblock** (supervisor's own call) rather than
  chased now; still pending either way.

### BR26.02 — Active — Low framerate while aiming  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** taskblock-26 (bout review), filed in the taskblock's own scope fence as explicitly
  deferred: "B-tier; investigate separately — likely the inspect field updating every frame; not a
  correctness bug, don't rush a fix into this block."
- **Status:** not investigated. Flagged for the post-tb26 testing/tooling review (pairs with a "what
  does CC do repeatedly" audit) rather than fixed under taskblock-26's own scope.

### BR27.01 — Pending Confirmation — Player Step Out: four bugs, one system  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** taskblock-27: Step Out works for the AI but the player's own path was broken four
  ways — (1) doesn't open the dartboard, always resolves a center-mass shot; (2) charges MP for the
  automated legs; (3) the ghost snaps back to the base cell instead of holding the step-out
  waypoint; (4) the intended sequence (pick step-out → ghost holds the cell → dartboard opens there
  → fire resolves the whole move/fire/return) wasn't followed.
- **Root cause:** `TacticsController._confirm_step_out()` called `StepOutPlanner.build_triple()`
  wholesale the instant the player confirmed a candidate cell — queuing the WHOLE move+attack+move
  triple (an automated center-mass shot) in one click, never entering ordinary aim mode at all. The
  ghost "snapping back" was a direct symptom of this: the entire triple (ending back at origin)
  was queued and previewed in the same instant the step-out cell was chosen, so there was never a
  sustained moment where the ghost held the stepped-out position for the player to see. `MoveAction`
  had no discount mechanism at all — `StepOutPlanner`'s own doc comment stated "real MP/AP cost for
  both legs, no discount" as a deliberate original design choice.
- **Fix:** split the flow. Confirming a step-out cell now queues ONLY the free outbound leg
  (`MoveAction.free`, new — no MP/AP either direction, docs/SUPERSEDED.md), then hands off into
  ORDINARY aim mode from the stepped-out position (`_framing_shooter()`/`aim_state()` already read
  the previewed unit, so the camera and dartboard follow the queued move for free). Firing
  (confirm_shot() again, now in aim mode) appends the free return leg once a real shot actually
  queues. Canceling aim mid-step-out (before firing) undoes the queued outbound leg. The ghost
  "snapping back" is now correct, not a bug — it only happens once the return leg is genuinely
  queued (after firing), the truthful final resting position; during the aim phase it holds the
  stepped-out cell via the same queued-move preview machinery every other action already uses.
  `free` applies to the AI's own `StepOutPlanner` usage too, not just the player's — the same shared
  maneuver, same cost either way.
- **RESOLVED-PENDING-CONFIRMATION** [CC 83fb8082-732a-4a4f-a726-04186087ef69] — taskblock-27 Pass B,
  proven via `test_tactics_controller_step_out.gd`'s updated/new tests (cell-confirm queues only the
  free out-leg and opens aim; firing completes the free triple; canceling aim undoes the out-leg)
  and `test_step_out_planner.gd::test_the_triple_costs_no_mp_for_either_leg`.
- **2026-07-20:** supervisor could not verify — blocked by a new, separate bug (now logged as
  **BR27.06 — Step Out no longer occurs at all**, a regression from this very restructure). Until
  BR27.06 is fixed, BR27.01 can't be confirmed. **Verification deferred**; still pending, and now
  gated behind BR27.06.

### BR27.02 — Active — Chaingun bursts fire half-backward (visual only, hits are correct)  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** 2026-07-20, observed watching a live bout play out — "the most recent two chaingun
  bursts look odd, both look like half the burst is going backward."
- **First fix (taskblock-27 Pass A1):** every attack action's shot-plane `direction` was cell-anchored
  while `origin` was muzzle-anchored — two different anchors for the same ray, which could resolve a
  target at negative depth and animate as the round travelling backward. Both now share the muzzle
  anchor. **RESOLVED-PENDING-CONFIRMATION** [CC 83fb8082-732a-4a4f-a726-04186087ef69] at the time,
  proven via a constructed overshoot-geometry test.
- **2026-07-20: supervisor reports still visually backward** — but with a key new detail: "those
  backwards shots do seem to be hitting the things they're drawn as hitting." The actual hit
  resolution (which part takes the damage) is correct; only the drawn tracer/animation direction
  still reads as backward. This means the Pass A1 fix (a `ShotPlane`/`AttackAction` geometry fix)
  either isn't the code path driving the visible tracer, or there's a second, separate anchor
  mismatch specifically in the rendering path (`resolution_player.gd`'s own tracer-drawing code, not
  yet audited against this same origin/direction-anchor class of bug). **Reopened — not
  investigated further this pass**, per instruction to just log and wait.
- **2026-07-20 (taskblock-28 Pass C):** not investigated or fixed this pass either — but
  `out/combat.log` now prints every impact/miss event's own real origin/hit geometry (was already in
  `data` since tb22/23; `LogEvent._to_string()` just never rendered it, and `Overwatch._fire`'s own
  separate impact path had no geometry at all until this pass routed it through the shared logger).
  A future session chasing this bug can read the geometry straight from the log text instead of
  re-deriving it or relying on live playback. Still open; still unconfirmed.

### BR27.03 — Active — Other shots appear to resolve before an earlier shot's own deflect finishes  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** 2026-07-20, correcting a taskblock-27 misdiagnosis (see the correction note in
  `taskblock_done/Report-Taskblock27.md`): a shot and its own deflect are SUPPOSED to resolve
  simultaneously (not paused apart, as taskblock-27 Pass A2 assumed) — the real defect is that a
  DIFFERENT, later shot can appear to resolve/animate before an earlier shot's own deflect segment
  has finished.
- **Status:** not yet investigated. taskblock-27 Pass A2's own `DEFLECT_BEAT_MS` fix inserted a
  deliberate pause between a primary hit and its own deflect — per this correction, that pause is
  itself a wrong implementation of the actual intent (simultaneous primary+deflect) and does not
  address this bug at all. Likely candidate: `ResolutionPlayer`'s own inter-event sequencing between
  separate impact events, not the intra-event primary/deflect pairing `DEFLECT_BEAT_MS` targeted.

### BR27.04 — Active — Lighting differs between spectator and player view  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** taskblock-27 D1b: spectator and player view are said to light the board
  differently.
- **Investigated, no code fix applied:** `BattleScene._ready()` already builds
  `WorldPalette.world_environment()` and `WorldPalette.directional_light()` exactly once, as
  children of the shared `BattleScene` itself — strictly before either overlay
  (`SquadControlOverlay`/`SpectatorOverlay`) is installed via `set_overlay()`. Neither overlay
  constructs its own lighting anywhere; both render the same lights on the same world. The code
  does not support the premise of a divergence as currently written.
- **Status:** not resolved — needs the supervisor's own visual re-check (a real screenshot
  comparison) rather than a code claim, since no divergent lighting path was found to remove.

### BR27.05 — Active — Action bar items still selectable without enough AP  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** 2026-07-20 (tb27 review). The tb27 Pass D3 fix (dim/disable unaffordable action-bar
  slots) **did not hold** — slots are still clickable/armable when the unit can't afford them.
- **Status:** reopened. The `ActionBar._can_afford()` gate either isn't wired to the slot's actual
  interactivity, or the AP compared isn't the unit's live AP. Not yet re-investigated.

### BR27.06 — Active — Step Out no longer occurs at all  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** 2026-07-20 (tb27 review). After the tb27 Pass B flow restructure (BR27.01), Step Out
  now **doesn't happen at all** for the player — a regression past the original four symptoms.
- **Status:** reopened, and likely *the* blocker that stopped the supervisor verifying BR27.01/BR26.01
  ("blocked by a new, separate bug encountered during the attempt"). The split-flow restructure
  (confirm-cell → free out-leg → aim mode → fire → free return) probably breaks such that no step-out
  path completes. High priority — it gates confirmation of two other pending bugs.
- **2026-07-21 (taskblock-30): could not reproduce through any headless path — logged as a real
  negative result, not a fix.** Three new regression tests, each a strictly more realistic
  reproduction of the reported click sequence than the last, all pass on the SAME covered-corridor
  geometry `test_tactics_controller_step_out.gd` already used:
  1. `test_a_real_mouse_click_on_a_covered_enemy_also_enters_step_out_mode` — a real
     `InputEventMouseButton` through a real camera raycast into `TacticsController._handle_mouse_
     button` (every pre-existing test in the file drove `click_cell()` directly instead — a real,
     previously-uncovered code path, just not the bug).
  2. `test_action_bar.gd::test_clicking_an_affordable_action_still_arms_it` (already existed, already
     green) — a real ActionBar slot click arms `&"shoot"` correctly.
  3. `test_squad_control_overlay.gd::test_the_real_production_wiring_enters_step_out_on_a_covered_
     enemy` — the full real `SquadControlOverlay`/`TacticsController`/`ActionBar`/`CameraRig` wiring
     (`_build_ui`'s own construction, not a bare `TacticsController.new()`), driven by a real
     action-bar click THEN a real raycast-driven board click, end to end.
  - **Every layer of the reported click sequence checks out correctly in isolation and combined.**
    Two live hypotheses left, neither confirmable headlessly: (a) the trigger condition
    (`UnitAI.is_covered_from` + at least one legal `StepOutPlanner` candidate) may simply be too rare
    on REAL `MapGen`-generated maps to ever fire in practice — reading as "never occurs" without being
    a code regression; (b) the supervisor's own repro used a different weapon/geometry/click sequence
    than this fixture reproduces. **Needs either a more specific repro (which map/weapon/exact
    clicks) or a real-map rarity sweep before further guessing is worth the cost** — not chased
    further this cycle, per tb30's "don't loop within a block" instruction. Still open.

### BR27.07 — Active — Active-turn highlight lands on the wrong unit; change to facing-marker-only  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** 2026-07-20 (tb27 review). Two parts: (a) **design change** — instead of recoloring the
  active unit's facing wedge + team marker (tb27 D2), the supervisor wants *only the current unit to
  show a facing marker at all* (the marker's presence indicates whose turn it is, not a color). (b)
  **bug** — the current-unit highlight sometimes lands on the *next* or *prior* unit, not the active
  one.
- **Status:** open. Note the design change supersedes part of D2 (which shipped as a feature in
  CHANGELOG) — the "recolor" approach is being replaced by "only the active unit has a facing marker."
  The wrong-unit bug may be independent (an off-by-one in whichever index drives the highlight) and
  should be checked even after the design change, in case the change is built on the buggy selector.

### BR27.08 — Active — "Resolve to here" has never worked  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** 2026-07-20 (logged now; long-standing — backburnered since the button's introduction).
  The "Resolve to here" turn-control (resolve queued actions up to a chosen point) has never
  functioned. Logged here now that the ledger exists so it stops being an untracked known-broken.
- **Status:** open, not yet investigated.

### BR27.09 — Active — Major hitch on new-turn or end-turn  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** 2026-07-20 (tb27 review). A significant frame hitch fires on either the new-turn or
  end-turn transition — supervisor can't yet tell which of the two triggers it.
- **Status:** open. First step is isolating which transition (instrument both, or bisect). Possibly
  related to per-turn work done synchronously (a full `refresh_unit_views` / re-resolve on the turn
  boundary).

### BR30.01 — Resolved — Debug-spawned unit renders no visual model  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** 2026-07-21 (tb30 follow-up, live bout review). "Spawn unit does not create a visual
  model, but the inspect shows it, indicating something all the debug options use is the issue."
- **Root cause:** `BattleScene.unit_views` was only ever populated once, in `load_battle()`'s own build
  loop. `BoutInjector.spawn_unit` adds a unit straight into `combat_state.units` — real data, inspect
  panel reads it fine — but nothing ever constructed a `HitVolumeView` for it.
- **Fix:** new `BattleScene.sync_unit_views()` diffs `combat_state.units` against `unit_views` and
  builds the missing view(s), the exact same construction `load_battle()` runs. Both overlays'
  `_on_debug_panel_applied` call it before `refresh_unit_views()`.
- **RESOLVED** 2026-07-21 — supervisor confirms: "Fixed for spawning units."

### BR30.02 — Active — Debug move_object mutates state but the model never visually moves  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** 2026-07-21 (tb30 follow-up, live bout review), tested BEFORE BR30.01 (spawn) in the
  same session — so NOT explained by testing move against an already-invisible just-spawned unit (an
  earlier CC theory here, now known wrong; see BR30.01's own history). Both "Move On Next Click" and
  manual cell-entry Apply are reported affected. `unit.cell` genuinely changes (confirmed via inspect);
  the rendered model does not.
- **Status:** could not reproduce through any headless path tried so far — logged as a real negative
  result, not a fix. Built a REAL `BattleScene` + `SpectatorOverlay`/`SquadControlOverlay`, drove the
  debug panel's actual `_on_apply_pressed()`/`applied` signal for real, and read `HitVolumeView`
  transforms (both the root and a child marker) back per CLAUDE.md's own view-math rule, across three
  scenarios: a fresh bout, a bout after driving several real AI turns through the normal animated
  `ResolutionPlayer` path first (in case a stale cosmetic offset from a real animation was leaking into
  a later debug move), and through both overlays. In all three, `battle.refresh_unit_views()` (already
  wired to the panel's own `applied` signal) correctly rebuilt the moved unit's mesh at the new cell —
  no bug found in `move_object`, `HitVolumeView.refresh()`, `UnitGeometry`, or the `applied` signal
  wiring itself.
- **Needs a more specific repro before further guessing is worth the cost** (per tb30's own "don't loop
  within a block" instruction): does the status label read "Move Object: applied"? Is the camera
  actually framing the destination cell (a correct-but-off-screen move would look identical to "nothing
  happened" without a wrong transform)? Does re-selecting/re-inspecting the same unit afterward show it
  at the new cell in the 3D view specifically (not just the inspect panel's own text)? Exact steps
  (verb used, source/destination cells, which overlay) would let this become a matching headless
  fixture instead of a fourth guess.

### BR30.03 — Pending Confirmation — Debug-removed unit never visually looks dead  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** 2026-07-21 (tb30 follow-up, same review as BR30.01/BR30.02): "clicking remove on a
  unit is removing it data side, but not visually."
- **Root cause:** `HitVolumeView.is_downed()` (the one check `refresh()` makes to pick the DOWN pose)
  reads `Unit.resolve_matrix() == null`, never `alive` directly — the same thing a REAL kill leaves
  behind (`DamageResolver.eject_matrix_if_needed` nulls the hosting part's own `hosted_matrix`, drops
  it as a loose `Grid.field_items` entry, THEN calls `kill_unit`). `BoutInjector.remove_unit` only ever
  did the `kill_unit` half — `resolve_matrix()` kept finding the still-docked matrix, so the view never
  changed.
- **Fix (first pass):** `remove_unit` now ejects the hosted matrix the same way first (drops it as a
  real field item at the unit's own cell), then kills as before.
- **Renamed to `kill` (2026-07-21, same-day follow-up):** the supervisor's own next request split debug
  removal into two distinct verbs — "Kill is a new feature, that forces matrix ejection the way you
  designed," separate from a generalized `remove_object` ("fully vanishing it," BR30.02's own report
  covers the move/spawn/remove-object round). This fix's own behavior is unchanged, just renamed
  `BoutInjector.kill` — `remove_object` (new) is debug-only cleanup with no matrix ejection at all.
- **RESOLVED-PENDING-CONFIRMATION** [CC a90c45b3-a806-42f8-b1d3-ea8bdc511a9a] — commit `c930930`
  (original fix), renamed in `6f42a4f`, 1860/1860 green.

## Legacy (pre-dates the `BR<taskblock>.<seq>` ID convention)
*(No ID to sort by — listed here, oldest work first, same relative order this ledger has always kept
them in. All `Resolved`.)*

### Resolved — Muzzle origin inside the shooter's own armor  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** taskblock-26 (bout review): "the muzzle originates at the shoulder socket's center
  ('the literal shoulder, not *from* the shoulder'), so the ray starts inside the shooter's own
  geometry and can hit its own armor."
- **First attempt (taskblock-26 Pass A2):** `UnitGeometry.muzzle_point` returned the weapon's own box
  CENTER, not its forward emission point. **Reported still present.**
- **Second attempt (taskblock-27):** re-diagnosed — the first fix touched a function no real firing
  action actually consumed for its horizontal origin; every real attack built the shot plane from the
  shooter's own bare cell center instead. All five action files now anchor the shot plane on
  `Vector2(muzzle.x, muzzle.z) / UnitGeometry.CELL_SIZE`, the shouldered muzzle position, computed
  before the plane is built.
- **RESOLVED** 2026-07-20 — supervisor confirms shots now consistently originate from outside the
  unit's own armor. taskblock-27 Pass A1 (fixing the chaingun-backward report, above) also removed a
  remaining anchor mismatch between `origin` and `direction` that had been obscuring a clean read on
  this one.

### Resolved — Extract-tile marker / facing-indicator z-fight  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** taskblock-26 (bout review), "same class as tb23's floor/indicator z-fighting."
- **First two attempts (taskblock-26 Pass A3, twice):** bumped `FACING_WEDGE_Y` in isolation each
  time. Both **reported still present.**
- **Third attempt (taskblock-27 Pass C2):** stopped bumping one marker in isolation and enumerated
  the whole ground-overlay height ladder instead. Found a real, previously unreported co-planar pair
  no prior test had ever checked: `TEAM_MARKER_Y` (0.01) was IDENTICAL to `EXTRACTION_TILE_HEIGHT`
  (0.010) — every unit standing on its own extraction tile z-fought, independent of the facing wedge
  entirely. Re-spaced all four named overlays as one ordered ladder with real clearance: extraction
  tile (0.010, unchanged) → team marker (0.06) → overwatch arc (0.09) → facing wedge (0.17).
- **RESOLVED** 2026-07-20 — confirmed by the supervisor. taskblock-27 Pass C2.

### Resolved — Spectator combat log word-wraps  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** taskblock-27 D1a: the spectator's own log label wraps lines; the player view's log
  already doesn't.
- **Fix:** `log_label.autowrap_mode = TextServer.AUTOWRAP_OFF`, the same setting the player-view log
  already carried — a direct port, not a new mechanism.
- **RESOLVED** 2026-07-20 — confirmed by the supervisor. taskblock-27 Pass D1a.

### Resolved — Inspect-on-hover missing in spectator view  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** taskblock-27 D1c (tb17-era note): inspect-on-hover should be on the shared control
  layer so both spectator and player view have it. Spectator view had none at all.
- **Fix:** `SpectatorOverlay._unhandled_input()` now routes `InputEventMouseMotion` to a new
  `_update_hover()`, reusing the same `UnitPicker.hit()` ray-pick the click handler already calls —
  whichever unit the cursor is actually over highlights (no "selected unit" gate; spectator view has
  no selection concept), mirroring `SquadControlOverlay._on_highlight_changed()`'s own
  clear-every-other-view behavior.
- **RESOLVED** 2026-07-20 — confirmed by the supervisor. taskblock-27 Pass D1c.

### Resolved — Wall tiles inspectable → opens the tile inspector  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** taskblock-27 D5: clicking a wall tile opens the tile inspector.
- **Fix:** `SpectatorOverlay`'s tile-click path now guards on `TerrainType.WALL` before ever calling
  `open_tile()` — a wall click is a real no-op, the same posture a miss off the board already had.
- **RESOLVED** 2026-07-20 — confirmed by the supervisor. taskblock-27 Pass D5. (The garbage-viewport
  symptom this report also showed was a distinct, deeper bug — see the next entry, found and closed
  by CC in the same pass.)

### Resolved — InspectPanel's null-root branch leaked stale isolate-viewport state ("garbage inspector")  ·  source: `CC`
- **Found:** while root-causing the wall-tile report above. `Grid.blockers` returns null identically
  for a wall cell and bare floor, so the tile lookup itself was never the bug. The real defect:
  `InspectPanel.open()`'s null-root branch (reached whenever `unit.shell.root == null`, which
  includes "no unit/object at this tile") never reset the preview viewport's own
  `own_world_3d`/isolate-focus state — so a "nothing to show" case could render an uncontrolled slice
  of the live board, carried over from whatever a PRIOR inspect had left the viewport in.
- **Fix:** the null-root branch now resets `_preview_viewport.own_world_3d = true` and calls
  `show_assembly(null, ...)`, so a "nothing to show" case can never leak the live-board state
  regardless of which caller reaches it.
- **RESOLVED** [CC 83fb8082-732a-4a4f-a726-04186087ef69] — taskblock-27 Pass D5, proven both ways
  (fails without the fix, passes with it) by `test_inspect_panel.gd`'s new
  null-root-resets-viewport-state test. CC-sourced: found, fixed, and tested entirely by CC in one
  pass, no supervisor confirmation gate applies.

### Resolved — Resource Editor — four layout bugs (stale-report source)  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** recurring through 2026-07-20 (arrived repeatedly as a `## User Request` to launch
  `run_resource_editor.sh` and screenshot the bugs). Era: taskblock 11 was the active block when
  first reported.
- **Symptoms:** (1) nothing resized/expanded on window resize; (2) no visible column-resize grab
  handles in the Tree header; (3) header bar changed height/width while interacting; (4) 3D preview
  z-fought the ground disc (needed zoom-in + upward offset).
- **RESOLVED** 2026-07-18, ~101 commits before the last stale re-report, in three commits:
  - `713f411` — layout never resized, columns wouldn't drag, preview mis-framed
  - `1bff29b` — garbage edits, silent save loss, header jitter
  - `944d019` — preview: drop the dummy-matrix carrier, add `show_assembly`
- **Verified** both in code and by direct supervisor observation of the corrected tool — so this
  `SUPERVISOR`-sourced bug is legitimately `RESOLVED` (the gate was satisfied: the supervisor
  confirmed it).
- **Why it kept recurring:** the fixes landed as plain bugfix commits *outside* the "Taskblock N Pass
  X" cadence, so the usual "update CHANGELOG on landing" never fired. With no closure marker anywhere
  and the tb11 spec still on disk in `taskblock_done/` (gitignored-but-not-deleted, per repo
  convention), the taskblock-generating instance treated the living docs as authority, found nothing,
  and re-derived "go verify the Resource Editor" as open. **This ledger is the fix for that class.**

### Resolved — Waist-line of impacts — the shot-plane Z-discard  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** through mid-2026-07 review passes ("a line of impacts across the waist"; "only seeing
  ~20% of shots"; "no ricochets").
- **Symptom:** projection collapsed `Vector3 → Vector2(x, z)`, dropping the height axis — so vertical
  scatter collapsed to a horizontal band and tracers/ricochets pinned to one height.
- **RESOLVED** in **taskblock 23** (true-3D shot resolution): projection retains height, the dartboard
  scatters in 3D, `resolve_ray` accepts vertical shots, tracers draw the real 3D path. Tagged in
  `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.

### Resolved — `los.gd` `range`-shadow (v1)  ·  source: `CC`
- **Symptom:** a param named `range` shadowed the builtin, failing at load/call time.
- **RESOLVED** in the v1 foundation work (noted historically in `docs/SUPERSEDED.md`). `gdlint` now
  catches this class faster than the engine does (see `docs/TOOLING.md` gotchas).

### Resolved — Deflect tracers never drawn  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** taskblock-26 (bout review): "the resolver produces DEFLECT outcomes (a review bout
  logged 25), but resolution_player.gd references DEFLECT zero times — the bounced secondary ray is
  computed, logged, never drawn."
- **Fix:** `taskblock-26 Pass A1` (commit `7c07445`) — every DEFLECT-outcome impact event now
  carries its own `deflect_end_x/y/height`, drawn as a second, visually distinct tracer segment.
- **RESOLVED** — confirmed by the supervisor.

### Resolved — Bout maker AI dropdown missing new playstyles  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** taskblock-26: tb24/tb25 added playstyles (overwatch-capable set, PSYCHOTIC, TURTLE)
  but the bout setup menu's own AI dropdown was a hardcoded, independently-maintained list.
- **Fix:** `taskblock-26 Pass C1` (commit `67c7ca8`) — `GenerateBoutOverlay.PLAYSTYLES` is now a
  direct reference to `UnitAI.PLAYSTYLES`, not a hardcoded copy.
- **RESOLVED** — confirmed by the supervisor.

### Resolved — Bout menu jumpy add/duplicate, not truly centered  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** taskblock-26: adding/duplicating a roster entry reflows jarringly; the menu reads as
  intended-centered but isn't.
- **Fix:** `taskblock-26 Pass C2` (commit `67c7ca8`) — anchors pinned to 0.5 with
  `GROW_DIRECTION_BOTH` (no baked offset); every row reserves the same `ROW_MIN_HEIGHT`.
- **RESOLVED** — confirmed by the supervisor.

### Resolved — Inspect header shows only the variant, not unit id/squad  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** taskblock-26: the inspect panel showed the bot's variant but not which unit/squad
  this actually was in the current bout — two units built from the same variant read identically.
- **Fix:** `taskblock-26 Pass C3` (commit `67c7ca8`) — the title bar now reads "INSPECT — Unit N
  (Squad M) — <variant>" once a unit is open.
- **RESOLVED** — confirmed by the supervisor.

### Resolved — Stab's slide-deflect could land back on the shooter's own body  ·  source: `CC`
- **Found:** while re-diagnosing A2 above (see that entry) — `DamageResolver._resolve_slide` (stab's
  own DEFLECT_MODE_SLIDE response) re-searches the WHOLE plane from index 0 with a lateral nudge, but
  hardcoded an EMPTY exclude list on that re-search, unlike every other plane lookup in `resolve_shot`.
  A stab that deflects and slides at point-blank range could therefore land back on the shooter's own
  body (which sits at the ray's own near-zero depth), the one lookup `resolve_shot`'s own first-hop
  exclusion never covered.
- **Fix:** `_resolve_slide` now takes `exclude_parts` and passes it through to its own `_find_next`
  call, the same shooter-parts list `resolve_shot` itself was given.
- **RESOLVED** [CC 83fb8082-732a-4a4f-a726-04186087ef69] — proven both ways (fails without the fix,
  passes with it) by
  `test_damage_resolver_deflect_modes.gd::test_slide_deflect_never_lands_back_on_the_shooters_own_excluded_body`.

## Notes on scope
- **Design reversals** (a decision that changed shape) go in `docs/SUPERSEDED.md`, not here — that's
  "the design used to be X, now it's Y," not "something was broken."
- **Known-limitations that are deferred by choice** (a stubbed system awaiting its phase) live in
  `docs/PLAN.md`, not here — they aren't bugs, they're unbuilt work.
- This file is only for **things that were broken**: reported defects and their closure.
