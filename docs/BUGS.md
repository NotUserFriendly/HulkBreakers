# BUGS.md — Bug Ledger

**The single place a bug's status lives.** New and resolved, with a rough report time and (for recent

**Status legend:** `Active` = open · `Pending Confirmation` = fix complete, supervisor verification pending · `Resolved` = confirmed fixed.
ones) the taskblock in play. Its job: **a resolved bug must have a closure marker here**, so an old
report — still readable in `taskblock_done/`, still describing acceptance criteria — is never
re-derived as open. If you fixed something, mark it RESOLVED here, even if the fix landed as a plain
commit outside the taskblock cadence. That out-of-cadence gap is exactly what let stale reports
recur.

**Convention:** one flat list, sorted by BR number ascending (`BR26.xx` before `BR27.xx` before
`BR30.xx`, lowest sequence first within a taskblock) — no category sections. **Status is inline in the
entry heading** (`Active` / `Pending Confirmation` / `Resolved`), right after the ID, so status and ID
are both visible while scanning. Entries reported before the `BR<taskblock>.<seq>` convention existed
have no ID to sort by — they follow at the end, in their own legacy block, oldest work first. Recent
entries get a timecode + taskblock; older migrated ones get a rough date. `RESOLVED` entries name the
fixing commit(s)/taskblock so the closure is verifiable.

**Every bug carries an ID:** `BR<taskblock>.<seq>` — e.g. `BR27.01` (Bug Report, reported during
taskblock 27, first of that block). **The ID is assigned at report time and never changes** — a bug
reported in tb27 stays `BR27.xx` even if fixed in tb30, so the handle is stable across its whole life
between supervisor, CC, and the reviewer. Put the ID in the entry heading.

**Every bug carries a `source`:**
- **`CC`** — found by CC during its own work (usually a pure-code bug). CC owns the whole loop
  (sees it, fixes it, tests it), so **CC may mark a `CC`-sourced bug `RESOLVED` directly.**
- **`SUPERVISOR`** — reported by the supervisor (the human overseeing the project). CC often
  *can't see* what was reported (a visual glitch, a "feels wrong" behavior), so it may have fixed
  the wrong thing. **CC may NEVER write plain `RESOLVED` on a `SUPERVISOR`-sourced bug.** The most
  it may write is **`RESOLVED-PENDING-CONFIRMATION`** (fix committed, CC believes it's done,
  awaiting the supervisor's verification). Only the supervisor promotes `PENDING-CONFIRMATION` →
  `RESOLVED`, and only after seeing the fix work.

**Session stamps.** CC has no sequential session counter — what it *does* have is a **session
UUID** embedded in its scratchpad directory path (e.g. `.../83fb8082-732a-4a4f-a726-04186087ef69/
scratchpad`). CC stamps its closure marks with the **full UUID**, not a shortened prefix — a prefix
is one collision away from misattributing a stamp to the wrong session on a long-lived machine, and
the full string costs nothing to write (e.g.
`RESOLVED-PENDING-CONFIRMATION [CC 83fb8082-732a-4a4f-a726-04186087ef69]`). If CC is refreshed it
gets a *new* UUID, so a later session reading an earlier session's `PENDING-CONFIRMATION` sees a
**different** stamp than its own — that's the signal it's *another instance's* unverified claim. It
must NOT promote it to `RESOLVED` on the strength of a prior CC's word, only on the supervisor's. A
pending mark whose UUID isn't your current one is a claim to re-check, not a closure to trust.

**End-of-taskblock digest.** At the end of each taskblock, CC lists every `SUPERVISOR`-sourced bug
it moved to `RESOLVED-PENDING-CONFIRMATION` this block — a "here's what I think I fixed, please
confirm" roll-up — so pending items surface at a natural review point without interrupting mid-work.

### BR26.01 — Resolved — Opposing team teleports before the player's own attack lands  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** taskblock-26 (bout review): "the last blue unit took its turn and the opposing team
  appeared to jump to new positions before that unit's attack animation resolved."
- **Root cause:** `SquadControlOverlay._on_turn_ended` called `advance_ai_turns(battle)` — which
  fast-forwards every AI turn with NO animation at all, a single instant `refresh_unit_views` at its
  own end — BEFORE the human's own turn had even started its own animated `resolution_player.play()`,
  and that `play()` call wasn't even awaited.
- **Fix:** reordered so the human's own turn is fully awaited through its complete animated playback
  before `advance_ai_turns` runs at all.
- **2026-07-20:** supervisor could not verify — blocked by a separate, new issue encountered during
  the attempt. **Verification deferred to the next taskblock** (supervisor's own call) rather than
  chased now; still pending either way.
- **RESOLVED** 2026-07-21 — supervisor could not reproduce on retry. taskblock-26 Pass B1.
- **2026-07-21, follow-up:** the underlying "AI batch is one synchronous, unanimated block" mechanism
  this bug's own fix left in place resurfaced as a heavy hitch instead of a teleport — see **BR27.09**,
  which now carries the live investigation.

### BR26.02 — Active — Low framerate while aiming  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** taskblock-26 (bout review), filed in the taskblock's own scope fence as explicitly
  deferred: "B-tier; investigate separately — likely the inspect field updating every frame; not a
  correctness bug, don't rush a fix into this block."
- **Status:** not investigated. Flagged for the post-tb26 testing/tooling review (pairs with a "what
  does CC do repeatedly" audit) rather than fixed under taskblock-26's own scope.
- **2026-07-21 (read-only investigation, `docs/Bugs-add.md`, rolled in here):** root cause is NOT the
  inspect field (the original guess) — it's `aim_view.gd:104-106`, a `_process()` override that
  unconditionally calls `refresh()` every single frame while aiming, even though `refresh()` is
  already correctly wired to the `aim_changed` signal (fired only on real state changes — reticle
  move, layer scroll, target change — from ~9 call sites in `tactics_controller.gd`). Each redundant
  frame call clones the preview `CombatState` and rebuilds the full-board `ShotPlane` twice (once in
  `aim_state()`, again inside `AimController.resolve()`), plus reallocates dartboard resolver/mesh
  objects. **Candidate fix (not yet applied):** delete or gate the `_process` override behind the
  same change-detection the signal path already provides.

### BR27.01 — Active — Player Step Out: four bugs, one system  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** taskblock-27: Step Out works for the AI but the player's own path was broken four
  ways — (1) doesn't open the dartboard, always resolves a center-mass shot; (2) charges MP for the
  automated legs; (3) the ghost snaps back to the base cell instead of holding the step-out
  waypoint; (4) the intended sequence (pick step-out → ghost holds the cell → dartboard opens there
  → fire resolves the whole move/fire/return) wasn't followed.
- **Root cause:** `TacticsController._confirm_step_out()` called `StepOutPlanner.build_triple()`
  wholesale the instant the player confirmed a candidate cell — queuing the WHOLE move+attack+move
  triple (an automated center-mass shot) in one click, never entering ordinary aim mode at all. The
  ghost "snapping back" was a direct symptom of this: the entire triple (ending back at origin)
  was queued and previewed in the same instant the step-out cell was chosen, so there was never a
  sustained moment where the ghost held the stepped-out position for the player to see. `MoveAction`
  had no discount mechanism at all — `StepOutPlanner`'s own doc comment stated "real MP/AP cost for
  both legs, no discount" as a deliberate original design choice.
- **Fix:** split the flow. Confirming a step-out cell now queues ONLY the free outbound leg
  (`MoveAction.free`, new — no MP/AP either direction, docs/SUPERSEDED.md), then hands off into
  ORDINARY aim mode from the stepped-out position (`_framing_shooter()`/`aim_state()` already read
  the previewed unit, so the camera and dartboard follow the queued move for free). Firing
  (confirm_shot() again, now in aim mode) appends the free return leg once a real shot actually
  queues. Canceling aim mid-step-out (before firing) undoes the queued outbound leg. The ghost
  "snapping back" is now correct, not a bug — it only happens once the return leg is genuinely
  queued (after firing), the truthful final resting position; during the aim phase it holds the
  stepped-out cell via the same queued-move preview machinery every other action already uses.
  `free` applies to the AI's own `StepOutPlanner` usage too, not just the player's — the same shared
  maneuver, same cost either way.
- **RESOLVED-PENDING-CONFIRMATION** [CC 83fb8082-732a-4a4f-a726-04186087ef69] — taskblock-27 Pass B,
  proven via `test_tactics_controller_step_out.gd`'s updated/new tests (cell-confirm queues only the
  free out-leg and opens aim; firing completes the free triple; canceling aim undoes the out-leg)
  and `test_step_out_planner.gd::test_the_triple_costs_no_mp_for_either_leg`.
- **2026-07-20:** supervisor could not verify — blocked by a new, separate bug (now logged as
  **BR27.06 — Step Out no longer occurs at all**, a regression from this very restructure). Until
  BR27.06 is fixed, BR27.01 can't be confirmed. **Verification deferred**; still pending, and now
  gated behind BR27.06.
- **2026-07-21:** BR27.06 now has a fix pending its own confirmation (commit `d42f744`). Worth
  re-attempting BR27.01's own verification alongside BR27.06's — same play session either way.
- **2026-07-21 (broken down by the supervisor, same session as BR27.06's confirmation):** parts (2)
  and (3) confirmed **RESOLVED** — no more MP charged for the automated legs, ghost no longer snaps
  back. Part (4) ("the intended sequence wasn't followed") was the supervisor's own original
  rephrasing of (1)-(3) together, not a distinct fourth symptom — folded in, not tracked separately.
  Part (1) has **mutated, not resolved** — reopened with a precise new repro: "clicking shoot, then
  clicking an enemy, doesn't bring up the dartboard if the unit had to step out; clicking again brings
  up the dartboard." Likely the two-step step-out flow itself (first click enters step-out-cell-choice
  mode, a second click/`confirm_shot()` is what actually opens ordinary aim mode per the Pass B fix
  above) reading as "doesn't work" without a clear in-between visual cue — not yet investigated
  code-side. **BR27.01 stays open for this one remaining piece.**

### BR27.02 — Active — Chaingun bursts fire half-backward (visual only, hits are correct)  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** 2026-07-20, observed watching a live bout play out — "the most recent two chaingun
  bursts look odd, both look like half the burst is going backward."
- **First fix (taskblock-27 Pass A1):** every attack action's shot-plane `direction` was cell-anchored
  while `origin` was muzzle-anchored — two different anchors for the same ray, which could resolve a
  target at negative depth and animate as the round travelling backward. Both now share the muzzle
  anchor. **RESOLVED-PENDING-CONFIRMATION** [CC 83fb8082-732a-4a4f-a726-04186087ef69] at the time,
  proven via a constructed overshoot-geometry test.
- **2026-07-20: supervisor reports still visually backward** — but with a key new detail: "those
  backwards shots do seem to be hitting the things they're drawn as hitting." The actual hit
  resolution (which part takes the damage) is correct; only the drawn tracer/animation direction
  still reads as backward. This means the Pass A1 fix (a `ShotPlane`/`AttackAction` geometry fix)
  either isn't the code path driving the visible tracer, or there's a second, separate anchor
  mismatch specifically in the rendering path (`resolution_player.gd`'s own tracer-drawing code, not
  yet audited against this same origin/direction-anchor class of bug). **Reopened — not
  investigated further this pass**, per instruction to just log and wait.
- **2026-07-20 (taskblock-28 Pass C):** not investigated or fixed this pass either — but
  `out/combat.log` now prints every impact/miss event's own real origin/hit geometry (was already in
  `data` since tb22/23; `LogEvent._to_string()` just never rendered it, and `Overwatch._fire`'s own
  separate impact path had no geometry at all until this pass routed it through the shared logger).
  A future session chasing this bug can read the geometry straight from the log text instead of
  re-deriving it or relying on live playback. Still open; still unconfirmed.
- **2026-07-21 (read-only investigation, `docs/Bugs-add.md`, rolled in here):** primary tracer
  read/write anchors now match (post first-fix) — no mismatch there. Suspect is the DEFLECT
  bounce-continuation segment: `resolution_player.gd:464-478` draws from the hit point to
  `deflect_end_*`, computed in `shot_resolution.gd:225-232` as `hit_point + reflected_dir *
  void_range`. `reflected_dir`'s sign/normal convention (`damage_resolver.gd:118-131`) has not been
  audited against this bug class — a flipped convention there would draw a visibly backward secondary
  ray for DEFLECT-outcome shots while leaving the real hit correct, matching "half the burst backward,
  hits correct" exactly. **Bonus find (separate, same bug class):** `overwatch.gd:264-265` still
  computes `origin` as a raw cell-center — never migrated to the muzzle-anchor fix `AttackAction`
  received in Pass A1. A second live instance of the exact same anchor-mismatch class, in a different
  code path. Neither finding implemented or tested yet.

### BR27.03 — Active — Other shots appear to resolve before an earlier shot's own deflect finishes  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** 2026-07-20, correcting a taskblock-27 misdiagnosis (see the correction note in
  `taskblock_done/Report-Taskblock27.md`): a shot and its own deflect are SUPPOSED to resolve
  simultaneously (not paused apart, as taskblock-27 Pass A2 assumed) — the real defect is that a
  DIFFERENT, later shot can appear to resolve/animate before an earlier shot's own deflect segment
  has finished.
- **Status:** not yet investigated. taskblock-27 Pass A2's own `DEFLECT_BEAT_MS` fix inserted a
  deliberate pause between a primary hit and its own deflect — per this correction, that pause is
  itself a wrong implementation of the actual intent (simultaneous primary+deflect) and does not
  address this bug at all. Likely candidate: `ResolutionPlayer`'s own inter-event sequencing between
  separate impact events, not the intra-event primary/deflect pairing `DEFLECT_BEAT_MS` targeted.
- **2026-07-21 (read-only investigation, `docs/Bugs-add.md`, rolled in here):** confirmed not an
  intra-event bug — each `ResolutionPlayer.play()` call is fully await-serialized internally,
  primary+deflect included. The gap is a missing reentrancy guard: `play()` has no busy-flag, and
  `SpectatorOverlay.step_once()` (`spectator_overlay.gd:249-251`) calls `pause()` (only flips a bool,
  doesn't cancel anything in flight) then immediately awaits `_advance()` — so a Step/Play issued
  right after Pause can start a SECOND concurrent `play()` while an earlier turn's own deflect tracer
  is still animating. **Candidate fix (not yet applied):** add a busy/in-flight guard to
  `ResolutionPlayer.play()`, or have `pause()` actually await the in-flight `_advance()` before
  returning.

### BR27.04 — Active — Lighting differs between spectator and player view  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** taskblock-27 D1b: spectator and player view are said to light the board
  differently.
- **Investigated, no code fix applied:** `BattleScene._ready()` already builds
  `WorldPalette.world_environment()` and `WorldPalette.directional_light()` exactly once, as
  children of the shared `BattleScene` itself — strictly before either overlay
  (`SquadControlOverlay`/`SpectatorOverlay`) is installed via `set_overlay()`. Neither overlay
  constructs its own lighting anywhere; both render the same lights on the same world. The code
  does not support the premise of a divergence as currently written.
- **Status:** not resolved — needs the supervisor's own visual re-check (a real screenshot
  comparison) rather than a code claim, since no divergent lighting path was found to remove.
- **2026-07-21 (read-only investigation, `docs/Bugs-add.md`, rolled in here):** re-confirms the prior
  pass's conclusion — no new code path found. Genuinely needs the supervisor's own visual/screenshot
  re-check, not further code digging.

### BR27.05 — Resolved — Action bar items still selectable without enough AP  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** 2026-07-20 (tb27 review). The tb27 Pass D3 fix (dim/disable unaffordable action-bar
  slots) **did not hold** — slots are still clickable/armable when the unit can't afford them.
- **Root cause (2026-07-21, tb30):** `ActionBar.refresh()`/`_on_box_gui_input()` both compared against
  `tactics.selection.selected_unit.ap` — the raw, un-queued unit. Per docs/09's own "queuing mutates
  nothing," `unit.ap` never drops for an action that's merely queued this turn, only once it resolves
  — so any AP already committed to an earlier queued action (e.g. a move that burned AP once MP ran
  out) was invisible to a LATER slot's own affordability check, which kept comparing against the
  unit's full starting AP.
- **Fix:** both call sites now read `tactics.selection.previewed_unit()` instead — the same source
  `SelectionController.reachable_cells()` already uses for the identical reason (it replays the
  current queue and returns what's actually left).
- **RESOLVED** 2026-07-21 — supervisor confirms: "I just cleared it visually." Commit `1c13ae5`. New
  regression test queues a move that burns AP via 0 MP, confirmed it fails without the fix and passes
  with it (`test_action_bar.gd::test_an_action_already_queued_this_turn_counts_against_a_later_
  affordability_check`). 1861/1861 green.

### BR27.06 — Resolved — Step Out no longer occurs at all  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** 2026-07-20 (tb27 review). After the tb27 Pass B flow restructure (BR27.01), Step Out
  now **doesn't happen at all** for the player — a regression past the original four symptoms.
- **Status:** reopened, and likely *the* blocker that stopped the supervisor verifying BR27.01/BR26.01
  ("blocked by a new, separate bug encountered during the attempt"). The split-flow restructure
  (confirm-cell → free out-leg → aim mode → fire → free return) probably breaks such that no step-out
  path completes. High priority — it gates confirmation of two other pending bugs.
- **2026-07-21 (taskblock-30): could not reproduce through any headless path — logged as a real
  negative result, not a fix.** Three new regression tests, each a strictly more realistic
  reproduction of the reported click sequence than the last, all pass on the SAME covered-corridor
  geometry `test_tactics_controller_step_out.gd` already used:
  1. `test_a_real_mouse_click_on_a_covered_enemy_also_enters_step_out_mode` — a real
     `InputEventMouseButton` through a real camera raycast into `TacticsController._handle_mouse_
     button` (every pre-existing test in the file drove `click_cell()` directly instead — a real,
     previously-uncovered code path, just not the bug).
  2. `test_action_bar.gd::test_clicking_an_affordable_action_still_arms_it` (already existed, already
     green) — a real ActionBar slot click arms `&"shoot"` correctly.
  3. `test_squad_control_overlay.gd::test_the_real_production_wiring_enters_step_out_on_a_covered_
     enemy` — the full real `SquadControlOverlay`/`TacticsController`/`ActionBar`/`CameraRig` wiring
     (`_build_ui`'s own construction, not a bare `TacticsController.new()`), driven by a real
     action-bar click THEN a real raycast-driven board click, end to end.
  - **Every layer of the reported click sequence checks out correctly in isolation and combined.**
    Two live hypotheses left, neither confirmable headlessly: (a) the trigger condition
    (`UnitAI.is_covered_from` + at least one legal `StepOutPlanner` candidate) may simply be too rare
    on REAL `MapGen`-generated maps to ever fire in practice — reading as "never occurs" without being
    a code regression; (b) the supervisor's own repro used a different weapon/geometry/click sequence
    than this fixture reproduces. **Needs either a more specific repro (which map/weapon/exact
    clicks) or a real-map rarity sweep before further guessing is worth the cost** — not chased
    further this cycle, per tb30's "don't loop within a block" instruction. Still open.
- **2026-07-21 (taskblock-30, same-day follow-up): hypothesis (a) disproved, root cause found.** A
  60-seed sweep of real `MapGen` maps driven through full AI-vs-AI bouts (`BoutSetup.build_bout` +
  `BoutRunner`) found ~1850 genuine covered-with-a-legal-candidate encounters across those 60 seeds —
  not rare at all. `MapGen._scatter_cover` never sets `grid.opacity` (only `blockers`), so the
  overwhelming majority of those are also plainly LOS-visible and clickable, not "no LOS at all" edge
  cases. That ruled out (a) and pointed back at the code path itself — same bug class as BR27.05:
  `TacticsController._enter_aim_or_step_out_mode` read `selection.selected_unit` directly. Per
  docs/09's own "queuing mutates nothing," that stays at wherever the shooter started the turn until
  the queue resolves — so a player who moves toward/into cover and THEN arms a shot had cover
  evaluated from the STALE pre-move cell, silently falling through to ordinary aim mode instead of the
  step-out the shooter's real, about-to-be-true position warranted. Every existing test in
  `test_tactics_controller_step_out.gd` armed+clicked from the shooter's own turn-start cell, never
  after a queued move — the exact gap that let this ship unnoticed.
- **Fix:** swapped to `selection.previewed_unit()` — the same source `reachable_cells()` already
  reads for the identical reason.
- **RESOLVED** 2026-07-21 — supervisor confirms: "step-out is occurring." Commit `d42f744`. New
  regression test queues a move from an uncovered cell into the same covered cell every other test in
  the file starts at, then arms+clicks: confirmed it fails without the fix (falls into ordinary aim
  mode) and passes with it. 1862/1862 green.

### BR27.07 — Active — Active-turn highlight lands on the wrong unit; change to facing-marker-only  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** 2026-07-20 (tb27 review). Two parts: (a) **design change** — instead of recoloring the
  active unit's facing wedge + team marker (tb27 D2), the supervisor wants *only the current unit to
  show a facing marker at all* (the marker's presence indicates whose turn it is, not a color). (b)
  **bug** — the current-unit highlight sometimes lands on the *next* or *prior* unit, not the active
  one.
- **Status:** open. Note the design change supersedes part of D2 (which shipped as a feature in
  CHANGELOG) — the "recolor" approach is being replaced by "only the active unit has a facing marker."
  The wrong-unit bug may be independent (an off-by-one in whichever index drives the highlight) and
  should be checked even after the design change, in case the change is built on the buggy selector.
- **2026-07-21 (read-only investigation, `docs/Bugs-add.md`, rolled in here) — concrete ordering bug,
  confirmed:** `SquadControlOverlay._on_turn_ended()` (`squad_control_overlay.gd:573-582`) calls
  `refresh_unit_views()` — which flips the highlight to the new current unit — at line 574, BEFORE
  `await resolution_player.play(events)` at line 577 animates the unit whose turn just ended. The
  marker visually jumps to the next unit while the previous unit is still animating its own queued
  action. **Compounding bug:** `SingleUnitOverlay._on_turn_ended()` (`single_unit_overlay.gd:40-42`)
  calls `super._on_turn_ended(events)` WITHOUT `await` — since the parent implementation contains an
  internal `await`, this lets `_auto_select_if_current()` run immediately, racing ahead of the
  parent's own animation/AI-batch completion. **Candidate fix (not yet applied):** reorder so
  `refresh_unit_views()`'s highlight flip runs after the animation await completes; add the missing
  `await` in `SingleUnitOverlay`.

### BR27.08 — Active — "Resolve to here" has never worked  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** 2026-07-20 (logged now; long-standing — backburnered since the button's introduction).
  The "Resolve to here" turn-control (resolve queued actions up to a chosen point) has never
  functioned. Logged here now that the ledger exists so it stops being an untracked known-broken.
- **Status:** open, not yet investigated.
- **2026-07-21 (read-only investigation, `docs/Bugs-add.md`, rolled in here):** traces clean
  end-to-end now — button (`squad_control_overlay.gd:445-449`) → `QueuePanel._on_resolve_pressed`
  (`queue_panel.gd:104-107`) → `tactics.resolve_to_marker(_marker_index)`
  (`tactics_controller.gd:1006-1041`), which does slice the queue to a checkpoint index and resolve
  through it. Git history shows commit `888a25f` ("Resolve to Here now actually enables") already
  fixed the historical "button never enables" defect, with passing coverage in `test_queue_panel.gd`.
  **This ledger entry looks stale, not live — worth a quick supervisor re-check before spending
  further investigation on it.**

### BR27.09 — Active — Major hitch on new-turn or end-turn  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** 2026-07-20 (tb27 review). A significant frame hitch fires on either the new-turn or
  end-turn transition — supervisor can't yet tell which of the two triggers it.
- **Status:** open. First step is isolating which transition (instrument both, or bisect). Possibly
  related to per-turn work done synchronously (a full `refresh_unit_views` / re-resolve on the turn
  boundary).
- **2026-07-21 — pinned down, likely the same underlying mechanism as the now-retired BR26.01
  ("opposing team teleports"):** supervisor reports the transition precisely now — "at the end of
  player unit turns, there's a heavy lag spike, then all the opposing units move and act in one go."
  BR26.01's own fix only reordered so the human's own turn finishes animating BEFORE the AI batch
  starts; it never gave the AI batch itself any animation. A read-only investigation pass
  (`docs/Bugs-add.md`, rolled in here) confirms the mechanism: `advance_ai_turns`
  (`control_overlay.gd:68-83`) calls `BoutRunner.step()` once per consecutive AI unit with **no yield
  between iterations**, and each `step()` runs full per-candidate pathfinding/LOS/cover scoring via
  `UnitAI.plan_turn` — the entire AI batch executes synchronously in one frame, which is both the
  hitch (all that planning work landing in one frame) and the "one go" (no animation between AI units,
  just a single `refresh_unit_views` once the whole batch is done).
- **Candidate fix (not yet applied):** yield between AI units in the loop (e.g.
  `await get_tree().process_frame`) to spread the planning cost across frames instead of one
  synchronous batch — would likely also restore *some* per-unit animation pacing, though the AI batch
  is deliberately unanimated by design (only the human's own turn animates), so a fix here is about
  the hitch specifically, not necessarily adding animation.

### BR30.01 — Resolved — Debug-spawned unit renders no visual model  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** 2026-07-21 (tb30 follow-up, live bout review). "Spawn unit does not create a visual
  model, but the inspect shows it, indicating something all the debug options use is the issue."
- **Root cause:** `BattleScene.unit_views` was only ever populated once, in `load_battle()`'s own build
  loop. `BoutInjector.spawn_unit` adds a unit straight into `combat_state.units` — real data, inspect
  panel reads it fine — but nothing ever constructed a `HitVolumeView` for it.
- **Fix:** new `BattleScene.sync_unit_views()` diffs `combat_state.units` against `unit_views` and
  builds the missing view(s), the exact same construction `load_battle()` runs. Both overlays'
  `_on_debug_panel_applied` call it before `refresh_unit_views()`.
- **RESOLVED** 2026-07-21 — supervisor confirms: "Fixed for spawning units."

### BR30.02 — Active — Debug move_object mutates state but the model never visually moves  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** 2026-07-21 (tb30 follow-up, live bout review), tested BEFORE BR30.01 (spawn) in the
  same session — so NOT explained by testing move against an already-invisible just-spawned unit (an
  earlier CC theory here, now known wrong; see BR30.01's own history). Both "Move On Next Click" and
  manual cell-entry Apply are reported affected. `unit.cell` genuinely changes (confirmed via inspect);
  the rendered model does not.
- **Status:** could not reproduce through any headless path tried so far — logged as a real negative
  result, not a fix. Built a REAL `BattleScene` + `SpectatorOverlay`/`SquadControlOverlay`, drove the
  debug panel's actual `_on_apply_pressed()`/`applied` signal for real, and read `HitVolumeView`
  transforms (both the root and a child marker) back per CLAUDE.md's own view-math rule, across three
  scenarios: a fresh bout, a bout after driving several real AI turns through the normal animated
  `ResolutionPlayer` path first (in case a stale cosmetic offset from a real animation was leaking into
  a later debug move), and through both overlays. In all three, `battle.refresh_unit_views()` (already
  wired to the panel's own `applied` signal) correctly rebuilt the moved unit's mesh at the new cell —
  no bug found in `move_object`, `HitVolumeView.refresh()`, `UnitGeometry`, or the `applied` signal
  wiring itself.
- **Needs a more specific repro before further guessing is worth the cost** (per tb30's own "don't loop
  within a block" instruction): does the status label read "Move Object: applied"? Is the camera
  actually framing the destination cell (a correct-but-off-screen move would look identical to "nothing
  happened" without a wrong transform)? Does re-selecting/re-inspecting the same unit afterward show it
  at the new cell in the 3D view specifically (not just the inspect panel's own text)? Exact steps
  (verb used, source/destination cells, which overlay) would let this become a matching headless
  fixture instead of a fourth guess.
- **2026-07-21 (read-only investigation, `docs/Bugs-add.md`, rolled in here) — concrete asymmetry,
  confirmed:** in `debug_control_panel.gd`, the "Move On Next Click" path's own
  `_begin_move_on_next_click` (:349-363) explicitly snapshots the active object BEFORE arming the
  destination-cell picker, specifically to dodge a signal race (a comment at :344-348 explains why).
  But `_on_apply_pressed`'s OBJECT-param resolution (`_resolve_param`, :414-415) has NO equivalent
  snapshot — it reads whatever `_active` is live at Apply time. Since `_start_picking`'s one-shot
  listener (:371-379) shares the same `board_clicked` signal as the panel's always-on tracker
  (`_arm_active_tracking`, :185-192), clicking "Pick" on the destination CELL field can silently
  overwrite `_active` and swap out the intended unit object before Apply resolves it — explaining
  "data mutates, model doesn't move" without any bug in `move_object`/`HitVolumeView`/the `applied`
  signal itself. This would specifically explain the manual cell-entry Apply path IF the supervisor's
  own workflow used that field's "Pick" button rather than typing coordinates by hand. **Candidate fix
  (not yet applied):** give `_on_apply_pressed`'s OBJECT resolution the same snapshot-before-arming
  treatment `_begin_move_on_next_click` already uses.

### BR30.03 — Resolved — Debug-removed unit never visually looks dead  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** 2026-07-21 (tb30 follow-up, same review as BR30.01/BR30.02): "clicking remove on a
  unit is removing it data side, but not visually."
- **Root cause:** `HitVolumeView.is_downed()` (the one check `refresh()` makes to pick the DOWN pose)
  reads `Unit.resolve_matrix() == null`, never `alive` directly — the same thing a REAL kill leaves
  behind (`DamageResolver.eject_matrix_if_needed` nulls the hosting part's own `hosted_matrix`, drops
  it as a loose `Grid.field_items` entry, THEN calls `kill_unit`). `BoutInjector.remove_unit` only ever
  did the `kill_unit` half — `resolve_matrix()` kept finding the still-docked matrix, so the view never
  changed.
- **Fix (first pass):** `remove_unit` now ejects the hosted matrix the same way first (drops it as a
  real field item at the unit's own cell), then kills as before.
- **Renamed to `kill` (2026-07-21, same-day follow-up):** the supervisor's own next request split debug
  removal into two distinct verbs — "Kill is a new feature, that forces matrix ejection the way you
  designed," separate from a generalized `remove_object` ("fully vanishing it," BR30.02's own report
  covers the move/spawn/remove-object round). This fix's own behavior is unchanged, just renamed
  `BoutInjector.kill` — `remove_object` (new) is debug-only cleanup with no matrix ejection at all.
- **RESOLVED** 2026-07-21 — supervisor confirms: "looks fixed." Commit `c930930` (original fix),
  renamed in `6f42a4f`, 1860/1860 green.

### BR30.04 — Active — Waypoint colors shuffle when arming an attack and targeting a cover item  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** 2026-07-21, found while confirming BR27.05: "selecting an attack, then trying to shoot
  a cover item causes your waypoint colors to shuffle."
- **Status:** open, not yet investigated. Likely candidate given the symptom: `BoardView.
  show_ghost_paths()` cycles `LEG_COLORS` by queue index (`LEG_COLORS[i % LEG_COLORS.size()]`) — if
  arming an attack against a cover item (rather than a unit) somehow re-queues/re-indexes the existing
  move legs, or a targeting-mode preview call feeds it a different leg count/order than what's actually
  queued, the per-leg color assignment would visibly shift without the underlying queued path changing.
  Not yet confirmed — needs a real repro (which action, what leg count was already queued, which cover
  item) before touching the code.
- **2026-07-21 (read-only investigation, `docs/Bugs-add.md`, rolled in here) — confirms the ledger's
  own hypothesis above:** `LEG_COLORS` has only 4 entries (`board_view.gd:36-41`), cycled via `i % 4`
  (:376). Targeting a COVERED target routes through the step-out triple
  (`tactics_controller.gd:603-621`, `872-926`), which appends 1-2 extra "free" `MoveAction` legs
  indistinguishable from real ones in `show_ghost_paths`'s own input list — pushing the total leg
  count past 4 and wrapping colors. Targeting an uncovered unit adds zero extra legs, so it never
  wraps, which is why the bug only shows on cover-item targeting. **Candidate fix (not yet applied):**
  either grow the color palette past 4, or exclude free step-out legs from the color-cycling index so
  only "real" queued legs consume a color slot.

### BR30.05 — Active — Debug panel: clicks and scroll bleed through to the world board/camera  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** 2026-07-21, live debug-panel use. Two related symptoms: (1) clicking within the debug
  menu itself can also select a world cell (the click reaches the board underneath, not just the
  panel widget); (2) once the verb list's own `ItemList` is scrolled to the bottom, further scroll
  input bleeds through and zooms the world camera instead of stopping at the list's own end.
- **Status:** not yet investigated. Likely candidates: (1) some region within `DebugControlPanel`'s
  own layout still has a plain `Control.MOUSE_FILTER_IGNORE` container gap that isn't actually
  covered by an interactive child, letting a click over that gap fall through to the 3D
  viewport/`_unhandled_input` underneath (the same class of bug `docs/09` taskblock07 Pass B4 already
  fixed once elsewhere); (2) `ItemList`'s own scroll wheel input isn't marked handled once it can't
  scroll further, so the same wheel event continues on to `CameraRig`'s own zoom handler. Both are
  UI-event-consumption gaps in the SAME panel, not two unrelated bugs.

### BR30.07 / BR30.08 — Resolved — Pass D audit: `selected_unit` staleness, same class as BR27.05/BR27.06  ·  source: `CC`
- **Found:** 2026-07-21, taskblock-30 Pass D (a supervisor-authored audit task): "BR27.05 and BR27.06
  were the same bug in two places: view code read `selection.selected_unit` (raw, turn-start state)
  during the TACTICS phase, where — per docs/09's 'queuing mutates nothing' — `.cell`/`.ap` don't
  reflect queued-but-unresolved actions. ... Two instances days apart means this is a pattern, not two
  isolated bugs. Audit the rest." Every suspect read from the addendum's own list was checked (state vs
  identity), and none blind-fixed — each confirmed with a failing-then-passing test first.
- **BR30.07 — `TacticsController._confirm_step_out()` computed the outbound path from the stale
  cell:** `Pathfinder.astar(shooter.cell, firing_cell)` used `selection.selected_unit.cell` directly.
  `MoveAction.is_legal()` requires `path[0] == actual.cell` against wherever the unit's real
  (previewed) position is by validation time — so a move queued before triggering step-out silently
  failed `enqueue()` and fell through to `cancel_step_out()`, with no visible step-out at all. Every
  existing test armed+clicked from the shooter's own turn-start cell — the exact gap that also hid
  BR27.06 itself, in a spot BR27.06's own fix never reached (a different function). **State read,
  confirmed.** Fix: path from the queue's own preview instead, matching
  `_append_step_out_return_leg()`'s already-correct sibling pattern. Verified failing without the fix
  (silent cancel; queue only ever got 1 of the expected 2 entries) and passing with it.
  **RESOLVED** [CC a90c45b3-a806-42f8-b1d3-ea8bdc511a9a] — commit `8457ff0`, 1864/1864 green.
- **BR30.08 — `TooltipController.refresh()` showed LOS from the stale cell:** passed the raw
  `selected_unit` into `TileInspection.inspect()`, whose `visible_from_selected` field runs a real LOS
  check from `selected.cell` directly. A move queued toward a cell with different sightlines left the
  tooltip stuck showing visibility from the turn-start position. **State read, confirmed.** Fix:
  `previewed_unit()` instead. Verified failing without the fix and passing with it (an opaque cell
  blocks LOS from the start cell but not the queued destination). **RESOLVED**
  [CC a90c45b3-a806-42f8-b1d3-ea8bdc511a9a] — commit `8457ff0`, 1864/1864 green.
- **Checked, not a bug:** `TacticsController.step_out_exposure()`/`_refresh_overlay()`'s
  `Overwatch.would_trigger_at()`/`all_threatened_cells()` calls also read `selected_unit` directly, but
  tracing `would_trigger_at()`'s own general-case branch shows it always re-resolves the mover by `id`
  and explicitly relocates the CLONE to the candidate cell before checking arc/range/LOS, regardless of
  what the passed reference's own `.cell` says — the stale reference only changes which internal branch
  runs, never the final answer. A direct empirical probe (temporary diagnostic, not committed) confirmed
  no output difference. No entry filed.
- **Confirmed correct as-is, no change needed:** `MoveHooks.new(selected_unit.cell)` (both call sites)
  — these run during REAL `resolve_until()`, where `selected_unit.cell` genuinely IS the live starting
  cell, not a preview concern; `confirm_shot()`'s own `shooter` reference and `_append_step_out_
  return_leg()` (both already use raw `selected_unit` ONLY for `.id`/identity, deferring all real
  geometry to previewed state — the correct split); `ap_mp_pip_row.gd` (already reads `previewed_unit()`
  — pre-existing correct pattern); `weapon_panel.gd` (purely structural shell/part reads — hp, wounds,
  manipulators — no position or queue dependency).

### BR26.03 — Resolved — Muzzle origin inside the shooter's own armor  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** taskblock-26 (bout review): "the muzzle originates at the shoulder socket's center
  ('the literal shoulder, not *from* the shoulder'), so the ray starts inside the shooter's own
  geometry and can hit its own armor."
- **First attempt (taskblock-26 Pass A2):** `UnitGeometry.muzzle_point` returned the weapon's own box
  CENTER, not its forward emission point. **Reported still present.**
- **Second attempt (taskblock-27):** re-diagnosed — the first fix touched a function no real firing
  action actually consumed for its horizontal origin; every real attack built the shot plane from the
  shooter's own bare cell center instead. All five action files now anchor the shot plane on
  `Vector2(muzzle.x, muzzle.z) / UnitGeometry.CELL_SIZE`, the shouldered muzzle position, computed
  before the plane is built.
- **RESOLVED** 2026-07-20 — supervisor confirms shots now consistently originate from outside the
  unit's own armor. taskblock-27 Pass A1 (fixing the chaingun-backward report, above) also removed a
  remaining anchor mismatch between `origin` and `direction` that had been obscuring a clean read on
  this one.

### BR26.04 — Resolved — Extract-tile marker / facing-indicator z-fight  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** taskblock-26 (bout review), "same class as tb23's floor/indicator z-fighting."
- **First two attempts (taskblock-26 Pass A3, twice):** bumped `FACING_WEDGE_Y` in isolation each
  time. Both **reported still present.**
- **Third attempt (taskblock-27 Pass C2):** stopped bumping one marker in isolation and enumerated
  the whole ground-overlay height ladder instead. Found a real, previously unreported co-planar pair
  no prior test had ever checked: `TEAM_MARKER_Y` (0.01) was IDENTICAL to `EXTRACTION_TILE_HEIGHT`
  (0.010) — every unit standing on its own extraction tile z-fought, independent of the facing wedge
  entirely. Re-spaced all four named overlays as one ordered ladder with real clearance: extraction
  tile (0.010, unchanged) → team marker (0.06) → overwatch arc (0.09) → facing wedge (0.17).
- **RESOLVED** 2026-07-20 — confirmed by the supervisor. taskblock-27 Pass C2.

### BR27.10 — Resolved — Spectator combat log word-wraps  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** taskblock-27 D1a: the spectator's own log label wraps lines; the player view's log
  already doesn't.
- **Fix:** `log_label.autowrap_mode = TextServer.AUTOWRAP_OFF`, the same setting the player-view log
  already carried — a direct port, not a new mechanism.
- **RESOLVED** 2026-07-20 — confirmed by the supervisor. taskblock-27 Pass D1a.

### BR27.11 — Resolved — Inspect-on-hover missing in spectator view  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** taskblock-27 D1c (tb17-era note): inspect-on-hover should be on the shared control
  layer so both spectator and player view have it. Spectator view had none at all.
- **Fix:** `SpectatorOverlay._unhandled_input()` now routes `InputEventMouseMotion` to a new
  `_update_hover()`, reusing the same `UnitPicker.hit()` ray-pick the click handler already calls —
  whichever unit the cursor is actually over highlights (no "selected unit" gate; spectator view has
  no selection concept), mirroring `SquadControlOverlay._on_highlight_changed()`'s own
  clear-every-other-view behavior.
- **RESOLVED** 2026-07-20 — confirmed by the supervisor. taskblock-27 Pass D1c.

### BR27.12 — Resolved — Wall tiles inspectable → opens the tile inspector  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** taskblock-27 D5: clicking a wall tile opens the tile inspector.
- **Fix:** `SpectatorOverlay`'s tile-click path now guards on `TerrainType.WALL` before ever calling
  `open_tile()` — a wall click is a real no-op, the same posture a miss off the board already had.
- **RESOLVED** 2026-07-20 — confirmed by the supervisor. taskblock-27 Pass D5. (The garbage-viewport
  symptom this report also showed was a distinct, deeper bug — see the next entry, found and closed
  by CC in the same pass.)

### BR27.13 — Resolved — InspectPanel's null-root branch leaked stale isolate-viewport state ("garbage inspector")  ·  source: `CC`
- **Found:** while root-causing the wall-tile report above. `Grid.blockers` returns null identically
  for a wall cell and bare floor, so the tile lookup itself was never the bug. The real defect:
  `InspectPanel.open()`'s null-root branch (reached whenever `unit.shell.root == null`, which
  includes "no unit/object at this tile") never reset the preview viewport's own
  `own_world_3d`/isolate-focus state — so a "nothing to show" case could render an uncontrolled slice
  of the live board, carried over from whatever a PRIOR inspect had left the viewport in.
- **Fix:** the null-root branch now resets `_preview_viewport.own_world_3d = true` and calls
  `show_assembly(null, ...)`, so a "nothing to show" case can never leak the live-board state
  regardless of which caller reaches it.
- **RESOLVED** [CC 83fb8082-732a-4a4f-a726-04186087ef69] — taskblock-27 Pass D5, proven both ways
  (fails without the fix, passes with it) by `test_inspect_panel.gd`'s new
  null-root-resets-viewport-state test. CC-sourced: found, fixed, and tested entirely by CC in one
  pass, no supervisor confirmation gate applies.

### BR11.01 — Resolved — Resource Editor — four layout bugs (stale-report source)  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** recurring through 2026-07-20 (arrived repeatedly as a `## User Request` to launch
  `run_resource_editor.sh` and screenshot the bugs). Era: taskblock 11 was the active block when
  first reported.
- **Symptoms:** (1) nothing resized/expanded on window resize; (2) no visible column-resize grab
  handles in the Tree header; (3) header bar changed height/width while interacting; (4) 3D preview
  z-fought the ground disc (needed zoom-in + upward offset).
- **RESOLVED** 2026-07-18, ~101 commits before the last stale re-report, in three commits:
  - `713f411` — layout never resized, columns wouldn't drag, preview mis-framed
  - `1bff29b` — garbage edits, silent save loss, header jitter
  - `944d019` — preview: drop the dummy-matrix carrier, add `show_assembly`
- **Verified** both in code and by direct supervisor observation of the corrected tool — so this
  `SUPERVISOR`-sourced bug is legitimately `RESOLVED` (the gate was satisfied: the supervisor
  confirmed it).
- **Why it kept recurring:** the fixes landed as plain bugfix commits *outside* the "Taskblock N Pass
  X" cadence, so the usual "update CHANGELOG on landing" never fired. With no closure marker anywhere
  and the tb11 spec still on disk in `taskblock_done/` (gitignored-but-not-deleted, per repo
  convention), the taskblock-generating instance treated the living docs as authority, found nothing,
  and re-derived "go verify the Resource Editor" as open. **This ledger is the fix for that class.**

### BR22.01 — Resolved — Waist-line of impacts — the shot-plane Z-discard  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** through mid-2026-07 review passes ("a line of impacts across the waist"; "only seeing
  ~20% of shots"; "no ricochets").
- **Symptom:** projection collapsed `Vector3 → Vector2(x, z)`, dropping the height axis — so vertical
  scatter collapsed to a horizontal band and tracers/ricochets pinned to one height.
- **RESOLVED** in **taskblock 23** (true-3D shot resolution): projection retains height, the dartboard
  scatters in 3D, `resolve_ray` accepts vertical shots, tracers draw the real 3D path. Tagged in
  `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.

### BR00.01 — Resolved — `los.gd` `range`-shadow (v1)  ·  source: `CC`
- **Symptom:** a param named `range` shadowed the builtin, failing at load/call time.
- **RESOLVED** in the v1 foundation work (noted historically in `docs/SUPERSEDED.md`). `gdlint` now
  catches this class faster than the engine does (see `docs/TOOLING.md` gotchas).

### BR26.05 — Resolved — Deflect tracers never drawn  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** taskblock-26 (bout review): "the resolver produces DEFLECT outcomes (a review bout
  logged 25), but resolution_player.gd references DEFLECT zero times — the bounced secondary ray is
  computed, logged, never drawn."
- **Fix:** `taskblock-26 Pass A1` (commit `7c07445`) — every DEFLECT-outcome impact event now
  carries its own `deflect_end_x/y/height`, drawn as a second, visually distinct tracer segment.
- **RESOLVED** — confirmed by the supervisor.

### BR26.06 — Resolved — Bout maker AI dropdown missing new playstyles  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** taskblock-26: tb24/tb25 added playstyles (overwatch-capable set, PSYCHOTIC, TURTLE)
  but the bout setup menu's own AI dropdown was a hardcoded, independently-maintained list.
- **Fix:** `taskblock-26 Pass C1` (commit `67c7ca8`) — `GenerateBoutOverlay.PLAYSTYLES` is now a
  direct reference to `UnitAI.PLAYSTYLES`, not a hardcoded copy.
- **RESOLVED** — confirmed by the supervisor.

### BR26.07 — Resolved — Bout menu jumpy add/duplicate, not truly centered  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** taskblock-26: adding/duplicating a roster entry reflows jarringly; the menu reads as
  intended-centered but isn't.
- **Fix:** `taskblock-26 Pass C2` (commit `67c7ca8`) — anchors pinned to 0.5 with
  `GROW_DIRECTION_BOTH` (no baked offset); every row reserves the same `ROW_MIN_HEIGHT`.
- **RESOLVED** — confirmed by the supervisor.

### BR26.08 — Resolved — Inspect header shows only the variant, not unit id/squad  ·  source: `SUPERVISOR`
- **Reported:** taskblock-26: the inspect panel showed the bot's variant but not which unit/squad
  this actually was in the current bout — two units built from the same variant read identically.
- **Fix:** `taskblock-26 Pass C3` (commit `67c7ca8`) — the title bar now reads "INSPECT — Unit N
  (Squad M) — <variant>" once a unit is open.
- **RESOLVED** — confirmed by the supervisor.

### BR27.14 — Resolved — Stab's slide-deflect could land back on the shooter's own body  ·  source: `CC`
- **Found:** while re-diagnosing A2 above (see that entry) — `DamageResolver._resolve_slide` (stab's
  own DEFLECT_MODE_SLIDE response) re-searches the WHOLE plane from index 0 with a lateral nudge, but
  hardcoded an EMPTY exclude list on that re-search, unlike every other plane lookup in `resolve_shot`.
  A stab that deflects and slides at point-blank range could therefore land back on the shooter's own
  body (which sits at the ray's own near-zero depth), the one lookup `resolve_shot`'s own first-hop
  exclusion never covered.
- **Fix:** `_resolve_slide` now takes `exclude_parts` and passes it through to its own `_find_next`
  call, the same shooter-parts list `resolve_shot` itself was given.
- **RESOLVED** [CC 83fb8082-732a-4a4f-a726-04186087ef69] — proven both ways (fails without the fix,
  passes with it) by
  `test_damage_resolver_deflect_modes.gd::test_slide_deflect_never_lands_back_on_the_shooters_own_excluded_body`.
